### About me

I am working with the Norwegian node of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), which is an European research infrastructure providing databases, tools, services and interoperability solutions for researchers within the life sciences. My main focus these days is to develop a harmonised metadata model and infrastructure recommendations to help make a particular and broadly useful type of genomic datasets more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). To this end, I have initiated and received broad community support for the ["FAIRification of Genomic Annotations Working Group"](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fairification-of-genomic-annotations-wg/forum/topic/fairification-of-genomic-annotations-wg-case-statement/) within the [Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/). This is a continuation of the [FAIRtracks](https://fairtracks.net) project, whose web site I have designed and developed using VueJS/Nuxt.

I am also the main developer of [Omnipy](https://github.com/fairtracks/omnipy), a high level Python library for type-driven data wrangling and scalable workflow orchestration, designed to support metadata transformation needs required to align existing metadata to the minimal metadata model for the abovementioned RDA working group. Omnipy builds on the powerful Python libraries [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) (for runtime type validation/parsing) and [Prefect](https://prefect.io) (simple and powerful ETL solution for orchestrating data flows. Omnipy is broadly interoperable, currently supporting both JSON-based and tabular data content, including integration with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames, and other integrations are planned. Omnipy is currently under development and not released for general use.

I have also, over a number of years, been one of the main developers of the [The Genomic HyperBrowser](https://github.com/hyperbrowser/genomic-hyperbrowser), a generic framework for statistical analysis of genomic datasets (tracks), based on the [Galaxy framework](https://usegalaxy.org). The main deployment of the Genomic HyperBrowser is available at [hyperbrowser.uio.no](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no).

I have been programming since I was 9, which means I have over 35 years of programming experience. 

My main experience with various programming languages/frameworks, in chronological order: [ChipWitz visual programming (great game!)](https://emulate-in-browser.macintoshrepository.org/?macmodel=2&disk1=9121_chipwits_plus.dsk&disk2=9121_chipwits_plus.dsk&r), BASIC, [HyperTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk), C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, VueJS

These days I am mainly developing in Python. All my code is available through Open Source licenses
